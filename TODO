Future capabilities needed
--------------------------

- flag indicating that cancellation of commands is supported
   - patches for cancellation of key creation exists

- improve on the logging

- extend --ctrl (control) interface with more capabilities supported
  with the ioctls in the CUSE TPM

swtpm_cert:
  - support for AIK Certs; takes EK and Platform certs as input:
    - copy data from EK Cert      : 3.5.9  .11
    - copy data from Platform Cert: 3.5.9, .11
  - needs implementation of some more TPM specific X.509 attributes that
    encode the data in ASN.1;
   - Unified cert specs 3.5.9, 3.5.11, 3.5.22, 3.5.23. 3.5.24, 3.5.25,
     3.5.26, 3.5.27
