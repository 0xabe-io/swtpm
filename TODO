Future capabilities needed
--------------------------

- flag indicating that cancellation of commands is supported
   - patches for cancellation of key creation exists

- improve on the logging

- QEMU-like monitor for initiation of migration;
  adds a capability flag

   - only useful if migration error handling in QEMU can be properly
     supported so that fall-back to original host can work
     - either TPM or QEMU can cause the fall-back due to an error
   - needs to allow suspend/resume in QEMU
   - needs to prevent snapshotting in QEMU

swtpm_cert:
  - needs implementation of some more TPM specific X509 attributes that
    encode the data in ASN.1;
   - Unified cert specs 3.5.9, 3.5.11, 3.5.22, 3.5.23. 3.5.24, 3.5.25,
     3.5.26, 3.5.27
