Future capabilities needed
--------------------------

- flag indicating that cancellation of commands is supported
   - patches for cancellation of key creation exists

- improve on the logging

- QEMU-like monitor for initiation of migration;
  adds a capability flag

   - only useful if migration error handling in QEMU can be properly
     supported so that fall-back to original host can work
     - either TPM or QEMU can cause the fall-back due to an error
   - needs to allow suspend/resume in QEMU
   - needs to prevent snapshotting in QEMU
