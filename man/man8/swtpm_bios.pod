=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<swtpm_bios [OPTIONS]>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<swtpm_bios> is a tool that can send the commands to the TPM (I<swtpm> 
program) that typically are used by the BIOS to initialize the TPM.
The user can choose among several command line options as to what the
state should be with which the TPM is started.

This command requires the environment variable I<TCSD_USE_TCP_DEVICE>
to be set for communication via TCP. Otherwise it will use the device
set in the environment variable I<TPM_DEVICE> or fall back to use
I</dev/tpm0> to send the commands to. In TCP mode, the environment variable
I<TCSD_TCP_DEVICE_HOSTNAME> is used to indicate the host to send the commands
to. By default I<localhost> is assumed. The default TCP port is 6545 unless
the environment variable I<TCSD_TCP_DEVICE_PORT> indicates another port. 

This command will send the following sequence of commands to the TPM.

=over 4

=item B<TPM_Startup(chosen mode)> -- startup TPM

=item B<TSC_PhysicalPresence(0x20)> -- PhysicalPresenceCMDEnable

=item B<TSC_PhysicalPresence(0x08)> -- turn on physical presence

=item B<TPM_PhysicalEnable> -- enable the TPM

=item B<TPM_PhysicalSetDeactivated(0x0)> -- activate TPM

=item B<TPM_ContinueSelfTest> -- continue self test

=back

The following options are supported:

=over 4

=item B<-c>

Send TPM_Startup(ST_CLEAR) (default). This instructs the TPM to start
with clear state.

=item B<-s>

Send TPM_Startup(ST_STATE). This instructs the TPM to start by restoring
previously saved state.

=item B<-d>

Send TPM_Startup(ST_DEACTIVATED). This instructs the TPM to start in
deactivated mode.

=item B<-n>

Don't send a TPM_Startup command.

=item B<-o>

Only send the startup command and nothing else.

=item B<-cs>

Send a TPM_ContinueSelfTest command.
