=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<swtpm socket [OPTIONS]>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<swtpm> implements a TPM software emulator built on libtpms.
It provides access to TPM functionality over a TCP/IP socket interface.

Unless corresponding command line parameters are used, the
B<swtpm> program requires that the environment variable I<TPM_PORT>
be set to the TCP/IP port the process is supposed to listen on for TPM
request messages. 

The environment variable I<TPM_PATH> must be set and
contain the name of a directory where the TPM can store its persistent
data into.

The B<swtpm> process can be terminated by sending a
I<SIGTERM> signal to it.

The following options are supported if the I<socket> interface is chosen:

=over 4

=item B<-p|--port <port>>

Use the given port rather than using the environment variable TPM_PORT.

=item B<-i|--dir <dir>>

Use the given path rather than using the environment variable TPM_PATH.

=item B<-f|--fd <fd>>

Use the given socket file descriptor for receiving TPM commands and sending
responses. This option automatically assumes -t.

=item B<-t|--terminate>

Terminate the TPM after the client has closed the connection.

=item B<--log fd=E<lt>fdE<gt>|file=E<lt>pathE<gt>>

Enable logging to a file given its file descriptor or its path. Use '-' for path to
suppress the logging.

=item B<--key file=E<lt>keyfileE<gt>[,format=E<lt>hex|binaryE<gt>][,mode=aes-cbc],[remove[=true|false]]>

Enable encryption of the state files of the TPM. The keyfile must contain
an AES key of supported size; currently only 128 bit (16 bytes) keys are
supported.

The key may be in binary format, in which case the file size must be 16 bytes.
If the key is in hex format (default), the key may consist of 32 hex digits
starting with an optional '0x'.

The I<mode> parameter indicates which block chaining mode is to be used.
Currently only aes-cbc is supported.

The I<remove> parameter will attempt to remove the given keyfile once the key
has been read.

=item B<--key pwdfile=E<lt>passphrase fileE<gt>[,mode=aes-cbc],[remove[=true|false]]>

This variant of the key parameter allows to provide a passphrase in a file.
A maximum of 32 bytes are read from the file and a key is derived from it using a
SHA512 hash. Currently only 128 bit keys are supported.

=item B<-d|--daemon>

Daemonize the process.

=item B<--pid file=E<lt>pidfileE<gt>>

This options allows to set the name of file where the process ID (pid) of the TPM
will be written into.

=item B<-h|--help>

Display usage info.
